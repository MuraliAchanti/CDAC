1.	Write a program to convert ANSI string to Wide character string and vice versa. Use MultiByteToWideChar and WideCharToMultiByte for conversion and IsTextUnicode for testing the results.
2.	Implement a program where command line arguments passed to program are read via CommandLineToArgvW.
3.	Write a program to print environment variables passed to the console application. Also demonstrate the usage of ExpandEnvironmentStrings API. 
4.	Write a program to open an existing file with CreateFile and use ReadFile to read the contents of file till EOF and print the contents to console.
5.	Write a program to create a new file with CreateFile and use WriteFile to write text to file. Verify the written text by manually opening file in notepad/wordpad etc.
6.	Write a program which uses the API “CreateProcess” to create two child processes (say calc.exe and notepad.exe). Print handle and process Id of each child process. 
7.	Create a named event object with CreateEvent. Verify the presence of the created mutex with WinObj (Hint: Look in \ > Sessions > 11 > BaseNamedObjects). Also verify how kernel object is deleted when no longer used.
8.	Write a program to create a process using CreateProcess API.
9.	Create a console application and open a handle of a file for reading. Create a process (which is also a Console application ) with creation flag CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE and pass a handle of opened file as command line argument and print the content of file in child process.
10.	Write a program to create child process which inherits handles of the parent process via PROCESS_INFORMATION structure and CreateProcess.
11.	Write a program to create a child process. Use GetCurrentProcessId, GetCurrentThreadId, GetProcessId, GetThreadId, GetProcessIdOfThread to print process and thread information in each of the process.
